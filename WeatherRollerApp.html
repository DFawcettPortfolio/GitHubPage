<h1>Terret Primeval Weather Roller App</h1>

<p>TPE Weather Roller: </p> 

<p>This Android app, developed in Android Studio using Kotlin, automates recurring chart-referencing rolls for weather in the Terret Primeval Era campaign.</p>

<p>Traditionally, determining weather requires two separate rolls: a 1d10 roll to determine the weather effect, 
  and a secondary roll such as 1d6 or 1d10 to establish the duration of that effect. 
  Each weather effect has its own duration values, which can complicate this process during gameplay.
One of the slower interactions to resolve at the table was the final weather entry, Nyx's game, which causes the player
to roll twice on the chart and combine both effects - a process which my app has streamlined.</p>

<p>The TPE Weather Roller overcomes this inefficiency by automating both rolls, enabling users to generate a single weather instance on demand or create a custom multi-day weather timeline (one such use case is for extended journeys). </p>

<p>Results of this custom weather timeline can be exported as a PDF for easy sharing and reference during the game.</p>
