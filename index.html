    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--workaround to create a tab-->  I am a natural problem solver who is fascinated by the nearly limitless potential of technology to improve our lives. 
    As a Firefighter and 911 Dispatcher in the United States Air Force I learned discipline, compassion, and perserverance; 
    I now carry that experience with me, bringing a people-first mindset to my approach with a mix of curiosity, dedication, and abstract thinking.  
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  After leaving the military I traveled to Tacoma, recognizing the growth and opportunity this area had to offer, and Washington's beauty
    proved too irresistible for me to want to live anywhere else. After a period of adjustment I felt like I was growing stagnant without a new challenge, so 
    I went back to school and got my Bachelors Degree in Information Technology from The University of Washington, Tacoma. I now hope to put that to use to
    keep learning and growing in the exciting field of IT, especially in a position that helps my local community thrive.
