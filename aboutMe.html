<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I am a natural problem solver who is fascinated by the nearly limitless potential of technology to improve our lives. 
As a Firefighter and 911 Dispatcher in the United States Air Force I learned discipline, compassion, and perserverance; 
I now carry that experience with me, bringing a people-first mindset to my approach with a mix of curiosity, dedication, and abstract thinking.  
</p>
  
<p>
  After leaving the military I traveled to Tacoma, recognizing the growth and opportunity this area had to offer, and Washington's beauty
proved too irresistible to want to live anywhere else. After a period of adjustment I felt like I was growing stagnant without a new challenge, so 
I went back to school and got my Bachelors Degree in Information Technology from The University of Washington, Tacoma. I now hope to put that to use to
keep learning and growing in the exciting field of IT.
